Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for AcBi
===========================================
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) 
is to define the functional and non-functional requirements for "Paradox Mobile," 
a cross-platform mobile application designed to assist investigators.

1.2 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

API: Application Programming Interface – Interfaces for data exchange with external public sources.
E2EE: End-to-End Encryption – Encryption ensuring data is secure from source to destination.
RTL: Relational Time Lines – Chronological views comparing official and captured data.
SHA-512: Secure Hash Algorithm 512 – A cryptographic hash function for data integrity.
Tor: The Onion Router – A network for anonymous communication.
VPN: Virtual Private Network – A secure tunnel for internet traffic.
Noise Threshold: A configurable metric for detecting inconsistencies in data timelines.
Honeypot Inverso: A defensive mechanism generating fake data upon intrusion detection.
Local-First: Design where all processing occurs on the device, with optional external access.

2. Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective

It is a novel tool in the domain of anti-corruption technology.

2.2 Product Functions
The application enables users to:

Capture and monitor public data changes (e.g., new companies, financial movements, geolocations) via configurable APIs.
Build and visualize dynamic graphs of relationships between officials, families, and entities, with risk scoring.
Track full lifecycles of bureaucratic processes, flagging anomalies like ignored bids or accelerated timelines.
Generate relational timelines comparing official declarations to captured signals, calculating corruption probabilities.
Provide a central dashboard

2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

Primary Users: Investigators and detectives – Experienced analysts requiring forensic tools; 
assume technical proficiency in data interpretation but not in programming.

3. Specific Requirements
3.1 Functions Requirements are organized by module:

Module 1: Data Listener (REQ-1.1 to REQ-1.10): Integrate/verify APIs; capture metadata/changes in registries, finances, properties, geolocations; monitor projects/funds; ensure API resilience.
Module 2: Network Analysis (REQ-2.1 to REQ-2.10): Build/update graphs; cross-reference identifiers; score risks; detect transfers/groups; visualize/filter data.
Module 3: Process Tracking (REQ-3.1 to REQ-3.10): Trace lifecycles; flag irregularities; compare offers; cross with networks; visualize timelines.
Module 4: RTL (REQ-4.1 to REQ-4.10): Generate/compare timelines; calculate noise/paradoxes; detect contradictions; export as PDF.
Module 5: Time Paradox (REQ-5.1 to REQ-5.10): Dashboard with filters/alerts; flag cases; interactive maps/timelines; export reports.
API Manager (REQ-6.1 to REQ-6.5): Manual CRUD for APIs; dynamic parsing; validation; interactive diagram visualization.
