Change Request: Incorporation of User-API Editing Features (DELETE, EDIT) and API Usage History Logging for Auditing

Change Request Description:
RF-007: API EDITING - DELETE, EDIT
RF-010: API MANAGER
Request Date: February 18, 2026
Requester: Government
Description: Implement an API usage history log that records all API invocations for the add, delete, and edit operations.
Reasons for the Change: Government auditing requirement.
Impact on the Project:
Affected Modules: Module 1: Data Listener
RF-007: API EDITING - DELETE, EDIT
RF-010: API MANAGER
Planning and Timeline: Adds 1 additional week of work, distributed across development, integration, and testing phases. This extends the total timeline from 6 months to approximately 6 months and 1 week (25 weeks total).
Associated Risks: Requires additional security measures to prevent leaks in the history log.
Approval: Pending
Additional Effort Estimate: 40-50 hours of development (mainly Backend Rust Dev and Senior Crypto & Security for history encryption).

Updated Team Configuration
Based on the original planning, the change request is incorporated without adding new roles, but redistributing efforts. The team remains at 9 people (including the Cryptography Mathematician as a tentative role already considered). Responsibilities are adjusted to cover API history development and DELETE/EDIT operations.

Updated Table 2. Team (9 people – 6 months + 1 week full-time):

Updated Table 4. Project Phases:

Phase                                    | Weeks    | % of Total Time | Main Activities (Updated)                                                                                  | Roles with Highest Effort                  | Important Notes
