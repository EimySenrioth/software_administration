2. DESCRIPTION

2.1 General Description
The system must automatically detect whether a governmental API has been compromised, manipulated or is returning suspicious data through cryptographic integrity validations, heuristic response analysis, and comparison against historical patterns. This requirement is critical to guarantee the reliability of collected evidence and to protect researchers from falsified or maliciously injected data.

System performs API capture
    ↓
SSL Certificate Validation
    ├─ Is the certificate valid and known?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue
    │   └─ NO  → CRITICAL ALERT → Pause capture
    ↓
Response Schema Validation
    ├─ Does the structure match historical patterns?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue
    │   └─ NO  → WARNING ALERT → Log anomaly
    ↓
Heuristic Data Analysis
    ├─ Are values within expected ranges?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue
    │   └─ NO  → MEDIUM ALERT → Flag suspicious records
    ↓
Data Volume Verification
    ├─ Is the volume consistent with historical data?
    │   ├─ YES → Continue
    │   └─ NO  → LOW ALERT → Log for review
    ↓
Reliability Score Calculation
    ├─ Score > 80    → Data TRUSTWORTHY
    ├─ Score 50–80   → Data SUSPICIOUS (requires review)
    └─ Score < 50    → Data NOT TRUSTWORTHY (automatically reject)

Requirement ID         RF-004
Name                   Monitoring Changes in the Public Commercial Registry (New Companies Linked to Public Officials)

Priority               High
Status                 Proposed
Version                1.0
Date                   02/02/2026

2. DESCRIPTION

2.1 General Description
The system must automatically monitor Mexico's Public Commercial Registries (RPC) to detect the creation, modification, or dissolution of companies that may be linked to public officials under investigation. This functionality enables the identification of potential conflicts of interest, shell companies, hidden beneficiaries, and corruption networks through the analysis of corporate formation patterns and their relationship with officials and their close circles.

2.2 Process
Monitoring of RPC is initiated by configuring target states, officials, keywords, frequency, and retrospective period.
The system periodically queries state-level RPC APIs and portals to obtain new incorporation deeds.
Records are filtered by date and relevant information is extracted: partners, legal representatives, corporate purpose.
Captured data is normalized: name standardization, RFC and address cleaning, format validation.
Duplicate records are detected and removed to ensure dataset consistency.
Normalized information is compared against target officials using exact matching, fuzzy matching, and cross-referencing by RFC, CURP, and address.
Possible family relationships are also analyzed through surname matching.
If no match is found, the record is archived without further processing.
If a match exists, a risk analysis is performed considering dates, corporate purpose, capital, common partners, and tender context.
If the calculated risk is low, the event is logged only as reference.
If the risk exceeds the defined threshold, a high-risk alert is generated, the user is notified, and a case is created.
Finally, the case is enriched with additional information: tenders, asset declarations, network analysis, and cross-referenced timelines.

The system must allow tracing and monitoring of financial flows (budgetary transfers) that occur between different government agencies or public entities.

3. PROCESS

1. Ingestion: Module 1 (Data Listener) captures official records of budgetary movements (transfers, reallocations, fund releases) from official sources or financial APIs.

2. Processing: The system links each transaction to the sending and receiving agency. Module 2 (Network Analysis) is used to establish "finances" or "transfers_to" relationships between institution nodes.

3. Tracing: Module 3 organizes this data chronologically

4. OUTPUTS

* Timeline visualization

5. SOURCE

* Input data

6. RESTRICTIONS

* Nomenclature Matching: The system must standardize agency names


RF-028: APPROVAL CHAIN TRACING

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Field                  Detail
Requirement ID         REQ-TRACK-005
Name                   Tracing of Approvals and Signature Chain
Module                 Module 3: Process Tracking
Priority               High
Status                 In definition
Version                1.0
Date                   24/05/2024

2. DESCRIPTION
The system must generate a sequential and immutable trace of all approvals and validations associated with a file or administrative process.

3. PROCESS

1. Metadata Extraction

Chronological Ordering: Module 3 sorts approval events sequentially (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step N), based on timestamps

4. OUTPUTS

* Approval Chain Visualization

5. SOURCE

* Input data

6. RESTRICTIONS
Only if the APIs provide this information


RF-029: PREPARATION OF INFORMATION IN COMPREHENSIVE TIMELINES (MODULE 3)

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Field                  Detail
Requirement ID         REQ-VISUAL-006
Name                   Preparation of Information in Comprehensive Timelines (Module 3)
Module                 Module 3: Process Tracking
Priority               High
Status                 In definition
Version                1.0
Date                   24/05/2024

2. DESCRIPTION
The system must consolidate and structure all processed information within Module 3.

3. PROCESS

1. Data Aggregation: The system collects scattered events from Module 3: transfer dates (inflows/outflows), approval records, official document timestamps, and anomaly alerts.

2. Temporal Normalization: All date and time formats from different sources are standardized to a common timeline.

3. Layer Classification: Information is organized into categories or "lanes" within the timeline (e.g., Financial Layer, Administrative Layer, Legal/Beneficiaries Layer) to avoid visual overload.

4. Synchronization: Related events are linked

4. OUTPUTS

* Interactive Timeline

5. SOURCE

* Input data

6. RESTRICTIONS
Performance: The timeline must efficiently render hundreds of events without crashing the browser.


RF-030: VISUAL TIMELINE PER PROCESS WITH HIGHLIGHTED ANOMALIES

1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Field                  Detail
Requirement ID         REQ-VISUAL-007
Name                   Visual Timeline per Process with Highlighted Anomalies
Module                 Module 3: Process Tracking (Visualization)
Priority               High
Status                 In definition
Version                1.0
Date                   24/05/2024

2. DESCRIPTION
The system must generate a specific visual timeline for each selected process or file, graphically highlighting any detected deviation, irregularity or suspicious behavior.

3. PROCESS

1. Process Selection: The user selects a specific file or case within Module 3.

2. Interactive Detail: When interacting with a highlighted anomaly, a card is displayed with the technical justification of why it is considered a risk.

4. OUTPUTS

* Interactive Timeline

5. SOURCE

* Processed input data, RF-029

6. RESTRICTIONS
RF-029 must be operational
