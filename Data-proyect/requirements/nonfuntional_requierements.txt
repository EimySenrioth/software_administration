20 Non-Functional Requirements
Data Security: All collected and processed data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
Forensic-Level Security: End-to-end encryption (E2EE).
Immutable Digital Chain of Custody: Every piece of data captured, analyzed, or exported must have a certified SHA-512 hash and timestamp.
Operational Anonymity of the Investigator: Native support for VPN/Tor + automatic IP rotation.
Counterintelligence Resistance: Automatic detection and blocking of tracking attempts.
Offline Availability.
Scalability for Large Cases.
Tolerance for Outages.
Professional and Technical Interface: Dashboard designed for analysts.
Protection Against Evidence Tampering: Automatic detection of attempts to edit or inject false data.
Sandbox Detection and Reverse Analysis: The system must self-destruct or enter "false positive" mode if it detects that it is being analyzed in a virtual or debug environment. Code obfuscation: Binary code and scripts obfuscated with multiple layers (VMProtect, Themida, or equivalent) to hinder reverse engineering.
Memory dumping protection: Anti-memory dump mechanisms (anti-Process Explorer, anti-Cheat Engine, anti-DumpIt).
Automatic key and certificate rotation: Daily generation and renewal of encryption keys and certificates.
Keylogger and screen recorder detection: Automatic blocking or masking of sensitive input if capture tools are detected.
Traffic analysis protection: Use of padding, timing randomization, and dummy traffic to hide communication patterns.
Programmable self-destruction.
Reverse honeypot mode: The system can generate false data or deceptive signals if it detects intrusion attempts.
Internal researcher audit.
API monitoring and encryption.
