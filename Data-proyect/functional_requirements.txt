50 Functionalities
Module 1: Data Listener
API Integration
Verification of manipulated APIs
Metadata Capture
Listening for changes in the Public Registry of Commerce (new companies linked to officials).
Detection of bank account openings or public financial transactions of family members.
Monitoring of changes in properties and vehicles registered in the name of family members or acquaintances.
Capture of public geolocations of officials (from social networks or apps).
Listening for progress on specific tasks such as projects.
Listening for money transfers.
API Manager / Manual Configurator.

Module 2: Network Analysis
Construction of dynamic relationship graphs (officials ↔ family members ↔ companies).
Massive cross-referencing of phone numbers and emails in multiple public databases.
Cross-referencing of projects with information from APIs.
Risk scoring by degree of closeness (direct family member = 100%, acquaintance = 60%, etc.).
Detection of "shared accounts" or transfers between close circles.
Mapping of closed groups or chats where officials and beneficiaries appear.
Interactive visualization of graphs with zoom and risk filters.
Daily graph updates with newly detected signals.
Cross-referencing of eavesdropping information.
Section of collected data filtered by project type and bureaucratic process for investigators.

Module 3: Process Tracking
Complete tracing of the lifecycle of each tender (announcement → award → payment) or bureaucratic process.
Detection of direct awards without justification.
Monitoring of unusual accelerations in bureaucratic deadlines.
Historical record of each step with precise timestamps.
Automatic comparison between submitted bids and the winning bid.
Alerts if a process ignores lower or more competitive bids.
Cross-referencing of processes with beneficiaries identified in the network graph. Detection of unexplained budget transfers between departments.
Registration of approvals and digital signatures in sequence.
Visual timeline by process with highlighted anomalies.
Module 4: Relational Timelines (RTL)
Generation of relational timelines by politician/institution/project.
Calculation of the "noise threshold" (inconsistencies between declared and observed information).
Temporal comparison: official statements vs. captured signals.
Detection of approvals before official requests (Basic Time Paradox).
Algorithms to predict the probability of corruption based on historical noise (Advanced Time Paradox).
User-configurable threshold (e.g., >25% noise = high alert).
Comparative visualization of timelines (official vs. observed).
Detection of unexplained "skips" in the authorization flow. Recording of specific contradictions (e.g., "politician claims to be unaware of the company, but a family member is a partner").
Export of RTLs as PDFs
Module 5: Time Paradox
Main dashboard with filters by date, politician, institution, and project.
Chronological display of all RTLs with noise thresholds.
Push/email/SMS alerts when the noise threshold is exceeded.
Automatic flag: "Start Investigation Case" with collected evidence.
Interactive risk map by state/municipality.
Bulk export of reports for NGOs, journalists, or authorities.
"Paradox" mode: highlights serious temporal inconsistencies in red.
History of detected cases.
Interactive interface with animations.
Timeline with information sheets.
