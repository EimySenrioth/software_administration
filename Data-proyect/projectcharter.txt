Project Charter: Development of a Mobile Platform for Corruption Detection

The “AcBi” project consists of the design and development of a cross-platform mobile application 
(Android and iOS) aimed at researchers, journalists, and civil society organizations for the proactive 
detection of corruption patterns in the public sector. The solution is based on a local-first, 
offline approach, integrating five main functional modules: Data Listener (real-time capture and 
monitoring of public data), Network Analysis (construction of dynamic relationship graphs and risk scoring), 
Process Tracking (detailed monitoring of tenders and bureaucratic processes), Relational Time Lines 
(RTL, temporal comparison of declarations vs. captured signals), and Time Paradox (central dashboard with 
alerts and detection of chronological inconsistencies). The main objective is to provide a forensic intelligence 
tool that allows for the identification of anomalies such as irregular awards, networks of hidden beneficiaries, 
and “time paradoxes” (approvals prior to official requests).

The platform incorporates 20 non-functional extreme security requirements, including end-to-end encryption (E2EE), 
an immutable digital chain of custody using SHA-512 hashes and certified timestamps, operational anonymity through 
native Tor/VPN integration and automatic IP rotation, resistance to counterintelligence (sandbox detection, 
memory dump prevention, reverse honeypot, and programmable self-destruct), as well as protections against 
evidence tampering and reverse analysis. The application is built on a Clean Architecture combined with a 
local-first design, using Tauri 2.0 Mobile with a Rust backend for obfuscation. A key innovation is the 
interactive API Manager, which allows the user (detective or investigator) to manually configure data sources 
provided for the case (URLs, endpoints, parsing rules), visualize them in a dynamic diagram (with nodes and 
connections), and validate them in real time.
